Ghosts And Graves is a 6502 assembly NES demake of the puzzle game Tents And Trees!

Complete 25 worlds (700 levels in total) of mind-bending puzzles. 

- Dig around graves to reveal ghosts in the cemetary.
- Each grave can only have one ghost adjacent to it. 
- Each ghost is connected to only one grave.
- Make sure the ghosts don't touch (not even diagonally)!

Play four different game modes!

- Standard gameplay.
- Shy Ghost mode, where some lanes hide how many ghosts are there.
- No Shovel mode, where you can't use dig actions to narrow down where the ghosts could be.
- Time Attack mode, where you race to complete the level against the timer.

## Development

### Setup

I used [cc65](https://cc65.github.io/) as the assembler for this project. 

For C++ utilities, I used GNU g++ with clang-format to keep things neat-ish.

To automatically create NES ROMs as I was developing, I used `watchman-make`.

To install these utilities on your mac, run this command:
```
./setup.sh
```

This will also download nlohmann json for C++ utility usage to `./utils/src/shared/json.hpp`.

### The Dev Server

![devserver image](https://github.com/AnthonyBongers/GhostsAndGraves/blob/main/reference/devserver.png?raw=true)

To auto-generate the NES ROM as I'm developing, I wrapped `watchman-make` in the script:
```
./startdevserver.sh
```

This will kick off different Make commands depending on which files were changed.

If any errors occur during the ROM creation, you'll see a red error message. 

Have this running in the background while developing to make things a bit faster :) 

### Updating Graphics

All graphics were done in GIMP using lossless BMP formats, located in the `./raw/images/` folder.

The top portion of the BMP is for background tiles, and the bottom portion is for sprite tiles.

![nes image](https://github.com/AnthonyBongers/GhostsAndGraves/blob/main/raw/images/game.bmp?raw=true)

Each BMP has a config file alongside it. 
This file lets the conversion script know which colours in a given 8x8 tile correlate to which colour attribute in the resulting raw NES image data.

The `bmp2chr` utility in the `utils` folder will read these two files, and output the raw NES image data in the `./assets/chr/` folder.

### Updating Nametables

For nametable generation, I used NES Lightbox. 

I save these to `./raw/nametables/`, and then hook these up to the rle script in the Makefile.

These are then loaded from the `./assets/nametables/` folder in the source.

### Music and Sound Effects

I used Famistudio for music and sounds in the game. 

There aren't any cli tools available for auto-generating the asm out of the project files, so they are manually generated into the `./assets/sound/` folder.

### The Source

All the assembly can be found in the `./src/` folder.

If you're looking for the meat of the game code, you'll likely find what you're lookin for in the `./src/screens/` folder. 

I was learning as I was making this, so there's some inconsistency and weirdness, but I commented along the way to hopefully clear up any strange decisions.

The level and sfx assembly is in the `./assets/` folder, since I considered them as more of an asset than source code.
